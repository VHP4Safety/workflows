The molecular and cellular events by which PPAR&amp;alpha; activators induce rodent hepatocarcinogenesis have been extensively studied and elucidated. The weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized AOP for PPAR&amp;alpha; activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis is summarized here. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose&amp;ndash;response relationships for the key events associated with many PPAR&amp;alpha; activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. The key events (KE) identified include the MIE &amp;ndash; PPAR&amp;alpha; activation measured as a characteristic change in gene expression,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;KE2&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; increased enzyme activation, characteristically those involved in lipid metabolism and cell cycle control, KE3&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; increased cell proliferation, KE4 &amp;ndash; selective clonal expansion of preneoplastic foci, and the AO &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; increases in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. &amp;nbsp;Other biological&amp;nbsp;factors modulate the effects of PPAR&amp;alpha; activators.These modulating events include increases in oxidative stress, activation of NF-kB, and inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication. The occurrence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas is specific to mice and rats. The occurrence of the various KEs in&amp;nbsp;hamsters, guinea pigs,&amp;nbsp;cynomolgous monkeys are generally absent.\\n</td>\n",

       "dcterms:abstract                     Several therapeutic agents and industrial chemicals induce liver tumors in rats and mice through the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&alpha;). The molecular and cellular events by which PPAR&alpha; activators induce rodent hepatocarcinogenesis have been extensively studied and elucidated. The weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized AOP for PPAR&alpha; activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis is summarized here. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose&ndash;response relationships for the key events associated with many PPAR&alpha; activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. The key events (KE) identified include the MIE &ndash; PPAR&alpha; activation measured as a characteristic change in gene expression,&nbsp;&nbsp;KE2&nbsp;&ndash; increased enzyme activation, characteristically those involved in lipid metabolism and cell cycle control, KE3&nbsp;&ndash; increased cell proliferation, KE4 &ndash; selective clonal expansion of preneoplastic foci, and the AO &ndash; &nbsp;&ndash; increases in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. &nbsp;Other biological&nbsp;factors modulate the effects of PPAR&alpha; activators.These modulating events include increases in oxidative stress, activation of NF-kB, and inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication. The occurrence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas is specific to mice and rats. The occurrence of the various KEs in&nbsp;hamsters, guinea pigs,&nbsp;cynomolgous monkeys are generally absent.\\n\n",
